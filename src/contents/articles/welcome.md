# Welcome!

This is my first post for my new site, and first of all I want to thank you for being here! ðŸ¥¹

## Technical information

The website is developed with [NextJs 13](https://nextjs.org) using the
new [App Router](https://beta.nextjs.org/docs/getting-started) feature.
It's my very first experience with NextJs, so if you have pieces of advice to improve it,
please don't hesitate to share them!
I made it open source, and you can find it on [GitHub](https://github.com/danielzotti/new.danielzotti.it), thus feel
free to explore the code!

The main purpose of this website is to have an entry point to access all the information about me as well to collect
projects
and share personal ideas. Furthermore, I'll use it to get my hands dirty using new technologies and have fun with
coding.

> I'll let you find all the Easter eggs! ðŸ¤“

Here below a summary of the website sections:

### [Blog](/blog)

A section which mainly collects **technical articles about frontend development**, computer science but also whatever
could come to my mind.
Articles are written using `Markdown` format (which, as a developer, I love for its simplicity) and converted in HTML
through [markdown-to-jsx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/markdown-to-jsx) in order to be displayed on the website.

### [Projects](/projects)

A list of **demos** of projects I have made over the years.

### [Open Source](/open-source)

A selected list of **personal open source projects**. Data is retrieved directly from my GitHub profile
using [GitHub official API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest). 
It's a _work in progress_ section, but it'll be improved in the future.
