# Daniel's ambigram

## An **_AMBIGRAM_** is a calligraphic design that has more than one interpretation as written.

The term was coined by **[Douglas Hofstadter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambigram)** in 1983.

Ambigrams appear as **visually symmetrical words** and when flipped, they remain unchanged, or they mutate to reveal
another meaning.

**_"Half-turn"_** ambigrams undergo a point reflection (180° rotational symmetry) and can be read upside down, mirror
ambigrams have an axial symmetry and can be
read through a reflective surface (like a mirror or a mirroring lake), and many other types of ambigrams exist.


##### Inspired by this cool property, I decided to design a half-turn ambigram with my name!
